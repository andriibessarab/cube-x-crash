**Cube X Crash** is a Java game I developed as my final project for ICS4U.

## Technical
This game was built using Java and Swing _(yes, Swingâ€”not exactly the go-to for modern game development, but hey, sometimes you work with what you must)_, relying solely on Java's built-in libraries. The game uses a custom abstract class called `GameObject` to manage all in-game objects. It features a `ScreenManager` class that handles the game loop and all screen transitions. Game data is stored in a `.properties` file, which the game reads.

## Basic Instructions

- Launch a stack of balls to break blocks.
- After each launch, blocks move downward.
- As the game progresses, blocks require more damage to break, increasing the challenge.

## Block Types
